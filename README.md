# stackoverflow_2020_survey
In February 2020 nearly 65,000 developers told stackoverflow that how they learn and level up, which tools theyâ€™re using, and what they want.

About 55% of respondents identify as full-stack developers, and about 20% consider themselves mobile developers. The median number of developer type identifications per respondent this year is three, and the most common combinations include back-end, front-end, and full-stack developer. Pairs that are highly correlated include database administrator and system administrator, DevOps specialist and site reliability engineer, academic researcher and scientist, and designer and front-end developer.

Almost 85% of the respondents that are professional developers feel that formal education is at least somewhat important, which is contrary to the popular idiom that you don't need formal education to become a developer. However, almost 16% believe that it is not at all important or necessary.
